### Error Wireframes

I chose a non-relational database for my dating app for this reason, rooted in the fundamental differences between relational and non-relational databases.

dating apps deal with diverse and unstructured user-generated content, which often doesn't fit neatly into the structured tables of relational databases. Non-relational databases offer the flexibility to adapt to changing data formats and requirements without the constraints of fixed schemas, making them better suited to handle this variability.

the decision to use a non-relational database was driven by the need for flexibility, scalability, and enhanced performance in managing unstructured dataâ€”qualities that make it the ideal choice for delivering a seamless and responsive dating experience compared to the more structured and rigid nature of relational databases.

## Issues found during site development

I had issues with the speed of the page loading on the favourites page due to the size of the images being uploaded, I rectified this by employing python code to compress the images and converting them to base 64 to be passed into the image fields

![testing_issue_1](app/static/documentation/base.png)
#

Initially after uploading the dummy data to the database the profile images were not synced with the correct names, this was rectified by the restructuring of the profile pic numbering style

![testing_issue_2](app/static/documentation/account-mismatched.png)
![testing_issue_2](app/static/documentation/reorganised.png)


#

An issue arose when logging out of the app whereby going back would put the user back onto the dashboard despite being logged out, this was correcte by use of a unique function that redirects the user back to the login page if the have logged out based on the presence of their username in the session

![testing_issue_3](app/static/documentation/logout-fix.png)
#


## Manual testing

I performed various exercises on the site attempting to break the order of movement through the app and checking that all error handling occured correctly

![manual_testing_1](app/static/documentation/errorcheckone.png)
![manual_testing_2](app/static/documentation/errorchecktwo.png)
![manual_testing_3](app/static/documentation/errorcheckthree.png)

![manual_testing_5](app/static/documentation/errorcheckfive.png)
![manual_testing_6](app/static/documentation/errorchecksix.png)

## Automated testing

By cloning locally and installing with
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

the user can run an automated test using selenium and field data generated by faker

![automated-test](app/static/documentation/selenium.gif)

## Performance testing
I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
